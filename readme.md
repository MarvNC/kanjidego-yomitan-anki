# Kanji de Go for Yomitan and Anki

[Kanji de Go (Êº¢Â≠ó„Åß Go!)](https://plicy.net/GamePlay/155561) is a fun game
quizzing people on rare/exotic kanji terms. In this repository I have scraped
the terms from the game from [the fan wiki](https://w.atwiki.jp/kanjidego/) for
use in Yomitan (formerly Yomichan) and as an Anki deck.
